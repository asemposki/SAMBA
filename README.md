# BAND_BMM_Expansions
A repo for all of the code written involving Bayesian Model Mixing (BMM) applied to expansions of toy models (for now). 

Current files:

  - A .py file (class_expansions.py) that stores the code for the classes written to implement this project in a Jupyter notebook or another .py code.
  - A bare-bones Jupyter notebook (BMM_Expansions_Project.ipynb) that runs the classes in the file above and shows the output. 

TO DO:

  - Include unit tests (not yet implemented)
  - Organize, fix, edit, add, etc.
