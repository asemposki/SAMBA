# BAND Bayesian Model Mixing: Expansions of Toy Models
This repo stores the class structures and test code to perform BMM on two expansions in a toy model setting. 

Current files:

  - A .py file (class_expansions.py) that stores the code for the classes written to implement this project in a Jupyter notebook or another .py code.
  - A bare-bones Jupyter notebook (BMM_Expansions_Project.ipynb) that runs the classes in the file above and shows the output. 
  - A Jupyter notebook containing the ongoing analysis on the mixed model results when the cosine switching function is implemented.

TO DO:

  - Include unit tests (not yet implemented)
  - Organize, fix, edit, add, etc.
