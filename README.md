# SAMBA package: SAndbox for Mixing using Bayesian Analysis

Description: Bayesian model mixing is a novel concept that surpasses the more widely used Bayesian model averaging (BMA) in its use of location-dependent weights, allowing multiple models to dominate in regions where they are the most accurate model known, instead of averaging over all of the models in the space. In this repo, we store the preliminary code and tests of three model mixing techniques studied on a test case meant to symbolise the type of nuclear physics problem we want to apply these methods to in the future. This will, in the next few months, be compiled into a package to be released this spring/summer (2022) under the name of SAMBA---SAndbox for Mixing using Bayesian Analysis. This accompanies the paper we have posted to arXiv where we detail our work using these techniques on our toy problem: the zero-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory partition function.
