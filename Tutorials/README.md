# SAMBA Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorials designed to help you navigate SAMBA! There are three tutorial Jupyter notebooks contained in this folder to guide you through the three different BMM methods in SAMBA: the Linear Mixture Model (LMM.ipynb), Bivariate BMM (Bivariate_BMM.ipynb), and Trivariate BMM with a GP (GP_BMM.ipynb). Each tutorial has benchmark values you can check against to make sure SAMBA is operating properly on your machine. Open any of the notebooks to get started and see how SAMBA employs BMM with the current toy model setup! If you would like to see a walkthrough of the toy model problem before getting to the code, open `LMM.ipynb` first, where it has been laid out in full.
