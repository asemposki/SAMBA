# Fractional Power of Rational function method (FPR) data

This class contains the data for the results of the FPR method used in [Honda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2960). It obtains
a very precise mean function, but is unable to generate the uncertainty bands that Bayesian model mixing can achieve. It is used 
as a comparison in the [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.106.044002) published with this package.
